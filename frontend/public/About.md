# Printz - Decentralized Manufacturing

## About the Project

This is a Prototype for a 3D decentralized 3D Printing Platform.  
To get what is a 3D Printing Platform is, check out [iMaterialise](https://i.materialise.com/de/3dprint) or [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/).   


## Backstory

Me, Frank, worked at iMaterilise when I started to direct my career in Software.  
I was fascinated by the fact, I can upload any 3D Model and I get a price.  
I used it in the Medical Industry to make clear it is not as expensive as they think.  
Loved the simplicity, till today.  

After working in diffrent 3D Printing houses, I discovered Makerspaces and other Providers to print your 3D Object.  
Just google, 3D Printing \<YOUR CITY NAME\>  
Its everywhere. Thats where the Idea of decentralized Manufacturing is grounded.  
Now I am bigger and smarter, so I thought lets see what Mark and me are able to conjure up in the restricted time window.  

## How

Now, we go a bit technical.   
We provides a Service to upload your 3D Model.  
The 3D Model gets minted on the Blockchain.  
Now you are the owner of your 3D Model.  

You want to print it.  
You offer your 3D Object to the Market.  
The Market creates offers. Alias, for what kind of price they could print your 3D Model.  
You select your favorite.   
the money get locked and the manufacturing starts going.  

The manufacturer send the 3D Printing Model to you.  
He declares it as delivered and you declare it as received.  
Money gets unlocked and get send to the chosen manufacturer.

Check out the README's in the [Githu - Repository](https://github.com/FrankGito/printz).   
It structured by Folders. Every Folder has a README.md with more Information.
